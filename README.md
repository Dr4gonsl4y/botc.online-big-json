# botc.online big json
These are two .json files including every single Character in Blood on the Clocktower intended to work with Clocktower.online
Ideally, don't import them into Clocktower.online and instead copy and paste relevant parts into your own json, but hey I'm not your boss.
This includes every character officially released, with information taken from https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Main_Page as of the 18th of May 2025. I may update this as new characters release, but there's no promises.

## eEVERY SINGLE ROLE.json
This is a json with detailed descriptions for every character in the game. This is highly impractical, since Clocktower.online predictably wasn't made to handle 200 characters simultanously. Check this out if you think it's funny.
Most Characters are taken from the [source code of clocktower.online](https://github.com/bra1n/townsquare). Any character starting from the Alsaahir are transcribed by myself. I demarked this with a few linebreaks.

## New Roles only.json
If you want to make a custom script, and add the roles not on clocktower.online, this is probably the one you are looking for. As of right now, it contains the following characters:
Alsaahir, Banshee, High Priestess, Knight, Shugenja, Village Idiot, Hatter, Ogre, Plague doctor, Zealot, Boffin, Harpy, Organ Grinder, Summoner, Vizier, Wizard, Xaan, Kazali, Lord of Typhon, Ojo, Yaggababble.
Images for them are also included. Just make sure to check the "Show custom images" button in clocktower.online.

# Caveats
I have written this list entirely for private use, and made it in a daze after not sleeping for 28 hours. There are probably some errors. I also did not want to figure out night order, and completely remake the night order numbers in the jsons, especially since I don't know if there is an official published night order for every role, beyond the script tool showing night orders. 
I was prompted to upload this by a friend of mine, since this may be useful for other Storytellers. To be honest, I slapped all of this together to be semi-presentable and called it a day. This is all highly funcitonal. I may come back to clean up the sheet, or this repo. But I may not.
This is a derivitative work of a derivative work. So if either the creator of clocktower.online, or Blood on the clocktower wish me to take this repo down, or edit something, please feel free to message to about it. Reach out over discord at user "dr4gonsl4y" for fastest responses.
